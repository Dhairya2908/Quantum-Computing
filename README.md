# Quantum-Computing
This repo contains all the codes and projects completed by me in the field of Quantum computing. Languages- python(qiskit library)

# 1. Basic intro files:
1. 1st qiskit.ipynb : Just making the first circuit using hadamard and a not gate on a single qubit and measuring it.
2. 2qubit.ipynb: First circuit involving 2 qubits and entanglement.(Cnot and h gate)
3. CHSH.ipynb: Implementing the CHSH game
4. BB84.ipynb: Implementing BB84 protocol and depicting superposition.
